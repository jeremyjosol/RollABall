### Gameplay

**Player Controls**: The Player GameObject responds to player input by applying force. Physics interactions work as expected.

**Speed**: The Player's speed is currently optimal.

**Responsive Walls**: All walls in the game world are responsive to collisions, allowing for dynamic interactions as the Player navigates the play area.

**Risk of Falling**: Player can fall off the play area if they roll the ball towards a wall at full speed.

**PickUp Rotation**: PickUp GameObjects rotate smoothly.

### Work in Progress

* Custom play area (maze-like)

* Obstacle challenges

* Physics experimentation
